Smart Notes App is a dynamic, offline, browser-based productivity tool that allows users to create, manage, and organize notes efficiently. It is feature-rich and intuitive with zero backend dependencies.

This is NOT a hosted website. This app runs entirely in the browser using local storage (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) — making it a **fully offline project**. No server, no internet connection required after first load.

- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete notes
- ✅ Create checklists from note content

- ✅ Tagging system for better organization
- ✅ Export individual notes to PDF
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Theme switcher (Default, Matrix, Pastel, Aurora)
- ✅ Cinematic intro overlay and animated UI
- ✅ Reminder notification (local time-based)
- ✅ Particle background animation for visual flair
- ✅ Offline compatible — uses LocalStorage (no database or internet)
